# 👋 Hi, I'm [Pablo] — Blockchain Developer

I'm a Blockchain Developer with 3+ years of experience focused on writing secure and gas-efficient smart contracts in **Solidity**, mainly on **BNB Chain**. I’ve worked on several private projects in **GameFi** and **DeFi**, building systems that are both production-ready and battle-tested.

While most of my work has been under NDA or for private companies, here are some publicly verifiable contracts I’ve written or contributed to:

## 🕹 GameFi Contracts
- [0x7254...acf](https://bscscan.com/address/0x7254251d353e8cd70dc2709d117ad5d40a8f2acf)
- [0x14ae...340](https://bscscan.com/address/0x14ae7be9b7b32165599be5c6fefdeee7eabaa340)
- [0x61f2...f63](https://bscscan.com/address/0x61f2551da402e4d41a1c34a7e366df6c4632bf63)
- [0xc399...a49](https://bscscan.com/address/0xc3995ac4f538239f0a550426ad2969546550aa49)
- [0x641a...8f0](https://bscscan.com/address/0x641a96fd2703d2e63e604db49dcf84e74cfde8f0)

## 💰 DeFi Contracts
- [Testnet: 0x5dA6...075](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x5dA64d2Ff6996c9D7BF07324A2943ee157581075)
- [Mainnet: 0xb16c...610](https://bscscan.com/address/0xb16c4db422594d18e051d06cd75792a433d01610)
- [Mainnet: 0x29dc...72a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29d0cb5155e4d395f52d4fe320c37343bc64372a)
- [Mainnet: 0x2778...348](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2778b5f2aed8de1b2b87d372228a251662790348)


## 🛡 Security & Bug Hunting
I'm also passionate about **smart contract security**. I've performed independent audits and submitted findings to platforms like [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com), which has helped me sharpen my ability to spot vulnerabilities and analyze complex codebases, even if none of my submissions have resulted in bounties (yet!).

## 🌐 Web3 Full-Stack Journey
Beyond smart contracts, I'm currently expanding my skills into full-stack Web3 development using:
- **Frontend**: React, ethers.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript

## 🚀 Let's connect
I'm actively looking for opportunities where I can continue to grow, build impactful projects, and contribute to the future of decentralized tech.
